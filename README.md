This simple electronic load for testing power supply circuits was a popular lab-built piece of test gear at Maxim Integrated Products. It came to be known as the "Larry Load" by the lab rats at Maxim, because the design originated from and applications engineer named Larry Carr. Commercial electronic loads were available from companies like Kikusui, but those were not cheap (while Maxim famously *was* back then) and Larry Loads were unique in their simplicity, wide range, and every-day utility. Even today, I'm unsure if a commercial load box can be used to check power supply efficiency at, say, 10uA. After retiring from Maxim. I had always intended to build a few of these for home lab use. I finally did just that.
